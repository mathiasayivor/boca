# NOTE
This is a wip, it's not production ready yet. Had to upload this cos I want to access this project from anywhere (in case I'm not with my pc) plus, I need to add git (I was too lazy to add it from the beginning)

## NOTE 2
`/client` and `/server` directories would be moved to their appropriate repositories as project gets bigger

# TODO:
Do proper documentation

# REQUIREMENTS
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org)
* <s>[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/#installation)</s> [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop)
> <s>For some reason, the latest version of MongoDB wasn't working for me. So to avoid issues, it's safe to install version `4.4`</s>
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)
> Dont have Yarn? No problems. Just remove the `yarn.lock` file and use npm like normal in each directory (`/server` and `/client`)
